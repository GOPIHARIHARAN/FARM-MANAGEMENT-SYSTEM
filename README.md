Farm Management System (Java + PostgreSQL)
This is a console-based Java application designed to help farmers manage essential farm data. The system allows users to store and track crop details, yearly yield information, and fertilizer usage. It ensures clean database operations using JDBC and PostgreSQL, with proper validation to avoid duplicate entries.
The project includes automatic updating of yield and fertilizer quantities when the same year or fertilizer is re-entered. It also provides a simple prediction feature using PostgreSQL aggregate functions to estimate the average crop yield based on past records. A basic login module is included for user authentication.
Overall, this project demonstrates core skills in Java, JDBC, SQL, and database-driven application design.
